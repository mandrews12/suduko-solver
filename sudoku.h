/*  Sudoku Overview:
 *
 *  Sudoku takes a file of comma-separated lines and uses
 *  it to store a sudoku board state as a 1D array of ints
 *  in row-major order.
 *
 *  For Programming Assignment 05, this class will be used to
 *  test problem 3.
 *
 *  Problem 3 will be tested by calling the solve member function
 *
 *  Note: in a proper C++ class you would have Getters and Setters
 *  however, here we don't do that since all values are changed
 *  internally from within the class itself.
